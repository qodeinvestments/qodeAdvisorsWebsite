Comments:
1. Website font and colour combination is good: We can stick to this theme across the website.Black and red is perfect.
2. The message in red could change to two-three lines. {The best investments are : driven by data, are objective and emotion free, are carried out by Qode}
3. The first two images can be reviewed and changed to something better- And they can be made dynamic: Code could be scrolling and Chart can be interactive[ Speak to purnanand]- Make a video 
4. Investment Strategy: Title is proper, Add headers or a tag that shows the
   product Type:  Equity, Debt,
   Strategy type:  Long Only, Long Short, Market Neutral
5. Investment Strategy product: Images could be interactive and relevant - could give some insight to the investor [Provide stats that is like marketing material for the investor- performance and other stats]. The two icons on the strategy page can also be interactive and permanent
6. The idea with the investment strategy page is that we would not need to think much when we go live with a new strategy: It can be templatized.
7. Investment Strategy Page: Both the boxes are good and we can add the movement effect like on github. 
8. Blog: You can take some of the actual blog article content and add the title as well as the content which is viewable.
9. Add the subscribe to our banner section.
10. Header: Section to be like the apple website: No need to click, if you hover it can open up the sections
11. Header: We can add all the sections needed: Currently add everything that you can think of- we will narrow down as we move ahead.
12. Logo Alignment and size and colour can also change. Try in Red and another font - maybe some one as the website font.
13. Add header section to the home Page: Once we add the sections we will decide what relevant content to show on the home page below because currently its a little too short.
