              </h3>
              <p>1. <strong>Universe Selection</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We focus on companies with a smaller market capitalization which allows us to target small to mid-cap segments of the market with growth potential while maintaining liquidity and stability.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>2. <strong>Quantitative Scoring</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Primary Metric: ROCE:</strong> We prioritize Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) to assess the operational efficiency and quality of a company. A higher ROCE indicates a better use of capital in generating profits.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Additional Metrics:</strong> Other factors such as Alpha (performance against a benchmark), Debt-to-Equity ratio (to ensure financial stability), and Market Cap to Sales ratio (to evaluate value and growth prospects) are also considered in the scoring.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>3. <strong>Ranking</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Companies are ranked based on their overall quantitative scores. This step helps us systematically identify the top performers according to our defined metrics, ensuring that we only invest in the best options available.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>4. <strong>Proprietary Checks and Filters</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Verification:</strong> We conduct additional proprietary checks to ensure the credibility of the selected stocks. This includes scrutinizing trading volumes to avoid manipulated stocks and verifying financials to ensure they are accurate and reliable.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>5. <strong>Investment Selection</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Top 30 Stocks:</strong> Based on the rankings, we select the top 30 stocks that meet our criteria. This concentrated approach allows us to maintain a focused and high-conviction portfolio.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>6. <strong>Annual Rebalancing</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To keep the portfolio aligned with our strategy, we rebalance annually. This process involves adjusting the holdings based on the updated scores and rankings to maintain exposure to the best investment opportunities.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The rolling bucket analysis below illustrates this clearly: the first bucket consistently outperforms the second, and so forth. This demonstrates a strong cause-and-effect relationship between investing in high-quality growth companies and achieving superior returns.

              <ul>
                <li>Investing in small and mid-cap stocks often leads to higher returns due to their growth potential and risk premium, but they also experience significant downturns during bear markets, making them highly volatile.</li>
                <li>To address this, we implement dynamic hedging strategies using derivatives to protect your portfolio from sharp and substantial drawdowns.</li>
                <li>This approach allows us to preserve capital while staying invested, ensuring that we capture the upside when markets recover.</li>
                <li>Below you can see how our hedge mechanism was able to reduce drawdowns and sharp fall in Covid-19 crash.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Our 30-stock, equal-weighted portfolio is designed to be highly diversified, covering a broad range of sectors and industries, which helps to significantly reduce overall unsystematic risk.</li>
                <li>By focusing on the fundamentals of individual businesses rather than making broad macroeconomic predictions, we believe it's more reliable to assess how specific companies will perform.</li>
                <li>This approach avoids concentrating the portfolio in any single sector based on macro calls, allowing us to remain flexible and focused on what truly drives returns: the strength of the businesses themselves.</li>
